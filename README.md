# OOP-Animal-Assignment
An assignment/group project designed to simulate animal combat \
This particular version of the project will simulate the combat between two constellations. \
Making this a Star War. The series of fights will be known as The Star Wars.

The user(s) will first input whether there are two or one of them. Following that, they will select their constellations and give them stats. If there is only one player, they will be given an AI to fight. If there are two players, then they will fight one another.

The simulation itself will require no input from the player(s), but when it ends the player will need to select what occurs afterwards.
